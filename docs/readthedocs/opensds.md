# OpenSDS

## Introduction

The [OpenSDS Project](https://opensds.io/) is a collaborative project under Linux
Foundation supported by storage users and vendors, including
Dell EMC, Intel, Huawei, Fujitsu, Western Digital, Vodafone, NTT and Oregon State University. The project
will also seek to collaborate with other upstream open source communities
such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Docker, OpenStack, and Open
Container Initiative. 

It is a software defined storage controller that provides 
unified block, file, object storage services and focuses on:

* *Simple*: well-defined API that follows the [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) specification.
* *Lightweight*: no external dependencies, deployed once in binary file or container.
* *Extensible*: pluggable framework available for different storage systems, identity services, capability filters, etc.

## Community

The OpenSDS community welcomes anyone who is interested in software defined
storage and shaping the future of cloud-era storage. If you are a company,
